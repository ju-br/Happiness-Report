**The World Happiness Report claims that:**<p>
<div align="center"> The true measure of progress is the happiness of the people; that happiness can be measured; and that we know a lot about what causes it. Given this knowledge, it is now possible for policy-makers to make people’s happiness the goal of their policies. And each of us can live a wiser life.</div>

5 latent (psychological variables) are assessed:

1. Happiness:
           <p> “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”
           </p> 
 2. Social Support
           <p> “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”
           Response scale: O e 1
             </p> 
3. Freedom to make life choices
           <p> “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”
            Response scale: O e 1
              </p> 
4. Generosity
            <p> “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?”
            Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita
              </p> 
5. Perception of Corruption:
            <p>  “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses.
             </p>

 Additionaly, *gdp per capta* and *healthy life expectancy at birth* are also assed.

### Can we trust this data?
#### 
- Latent variables mensuration

    One item
        Validity and fidedignity
            

    Individual as reference from the country
        Average response of the overall perception at the individual level
        Multi level aggregation
        The national average response to the question of life evaluations
   ### Can we measure happiness with one item?
    Operationalization of Hapiness
   ### Validity
  ### Self report bias

   ### Can we say all the countries agree in what os happiness?
    Cross cultural evaluation
    Cross-cultural explorations reveal varying, multiple and often conf licting
beliefs within and between groups ( Jugureanu and Hughes 2010; McMellon 2013; Pedrotti
et al. 2009; Suh and Oishi 2004a; Tanaka 2013).
happiness research has been criticised for producing not simply descriptive but
prescriptive accounts based upon unacknowledged value judgments and (western) social norms

   ### Is this evidence strong enough to base public policies?
In recent years, interest in happiness has been growing across numerous disciplines, particularly
in the fields of psychology and economics.1 It has also become an increasingly significant object
of public policy both domestically and internationally with governments around the world considering
measures of happiness, or ‘subjective well-being,’ as progress indicators and tools for appraising
policy. Yet, the findings from happiness surveys are nonetheless often taken to be data
about an objectively verifiable construct (rather than a socially mediated expression
of feelings), and are used to issue advice to governments about policies that should maximise
happiness’ (Duncan 2005). This, according to Jugureanu et al., (2014), is the ‘axiomatic error’
of happiness studies: ‘the search for an eternal, unchanging, all-encompassing definition of happiness
involves the epistemological fallacy that happiness “has” a kind of essence that can be rendered
conceptually. However, there is often mixed, weak or inadequate evidence to support frequent
claims that, for instance, raising happiness will improve health (Bolier, et al. 2013; Coyne 2010;
Coyne and Tennen 2010; Veenhoven 2008a)4 educational outcomes (Ecclestone 2012;
Ecclestone and Hayes 2009; Furedi 2009) or that reducing inequality will raise happiness
(Saunders and Evans 2010; Snowdon 2010, 2012). Further, claims and activities of advocacy
groups are often cited as ‘research evidence’ (Ecclestone 2007:460), conclusions drawn from
findings not replicated in subsequent research (Freese et al. 2007; Lazarus 2003b; Mongrain
and Anselmo-Matthews 2012)5 or extrapolated from small studies or unrepresentative groups
(Fitzpatrick 2006; Miller 2008; Morrall 2009), and correlations treated causally (Ehrenreich
2009, Miller 2008; Saunders and Evans 2010).
## Why people data do not work?
HR analytics is about using data for informed decision making. The majority of variables of interest regard the H – human – in HR. They focus on abstract phenomena and one cannot measure them directly (e.g. job engagement).

Assessments are the most used method for data collection of soft variables. We need them to provide key information to answer research questions. We also use them to predict the impact on other HR variables and on business outcomes. So, the use of the right assessment is an important part of HR Analytics.
The ability to choose or develop assessments is an essential capability to be successful in the HR analytics field (Coolen & IJsselstein, 2015). Using validated measures is the safest and more economical choice. They are more reliable and developed following a strict process. An alternative to finding such measures is the Academy of Management Measurement Chest.


However, in-house development of HR assessments is quite common. We use assessments to measure perceptions, attitudes, and opinions of employees about HR and related outcomes. As they are so widespread, sometimes it’s tempting to develop in-house solutions. Or customize existing ones to our organization.
However, problems with measures’ reliability and validity often lead to unreliable metrics. For example, usually, in-house solutions are developed without a rigorous literature review to define the phenomena and to formulate items.
